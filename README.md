## A small introduction to the solution

The solution contains two projects, the
standalone REST API solution together
with the project that tests the
given solution.

Important note:
Players themselves are handled using
a "key", a combination of the provided
name (e.g., "adam") and a generated
GUID value. These values are
retrievable through calling /getUsers.
